## Restaurants Count in Las Vegas

We draw a plot showing a total count of restaurants by neighborhood level in Las Vegas. 
As a result, we found the Strip has the most restaurants across all neighborhoods in Las Vegas. 

- Downtown: total 340 restaurants 
- The Strip: total 818 restaurants 

```{r echo = FALSE}
restaurants_count <- restaurants %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n()) %>%
  arrange(neighborhood)

# Updated to Export Restaurant
#str(restaurants_count)


# selected seven restaurants 
s_restaurants_count <- restaurants %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(neighborhood %in% c("The Strip", "Downtown"))


n1 <- unlist(unique(restaurants_count[, "neighborhood"]))
 

# original graph 
original <- ggplot(restaurants_count, aes(x = reorder(neighborhood, n), y = n)) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.7, fill = "#c41200") + 
  labs(x = "Neighborhood", y = "Number of Restaurants") + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  ggtitle("Restaurants per Neighborhood in Las Vegas") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = 0)

# Create a new "selected" Column, marks the Strip and DTLV in dummy variables (selected =1, not selected =0)
restaurants_count$selected <- ifelse(grepl("The Strip|Downtown",restaurants_count$neighborhood),1, 0)

# updated graph, highlighting selected cities in different colors, and show counts of restaurants per all cities
ggplot(restaurants_count, aes(x = reorder(neighborhood, n), y = n, fill = as.factor(selected))) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Neighborhood", y = "Number of Restaurants") + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  ggtitle("Restaurants per Neighborhood in Las Vegas") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = 0) + theme(legend.position = "None")

```


## Proportion of Ratings by Neighborhood 

We compared the proportion of Restaurants' star ratings by neighborhood-level in Las Vegas. Star ratings are in scale of 1 to 5 and rated by Yelp Reviewers (i.e., consumers of restaurants).  

```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

restaurants_rating <- restaurants %>%
  group_by(neighborhood, stars) %>%
#  filter(neighborhood %in% c("The Strip", "Downtown")) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  spread(key = stars, value = n) %>%
  mutate(
    star1 = `1` + `1.5`,
    star2 = `2` + `2.5`,
    star3 = `3` + `3.5`,
    star4 = `4` + `4.5`,
    star5 = `5`
  ) %>%
  select(neighborhood, star1, star2, star3, star4, star5) %>%
  gather(star1, star2, star3, star4, star5, key = "star", value = "n")

# Omitting neighborhoods with misisng variables 
restaurants_rating <- restaurants_rating %>% na.omit()

s_restaurants_rating <- restaurants_rating %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  filter(neighborhood %in% c("The Strip", "Downtown"))

s_restaurants_rating <- s_restaurants_rating %>% na.omit()


# Renaming the columns to better account for values asked by an assignment Part 2 question 
restaurants_rating <- restaurants_rating %>% rename(Rating=star)
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
# distribution of restaurant ratings per neighborhood 
g1 <- ggplot(restaurants_rating) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = neighborhood, y = n, fill = Rating), stat = "identity", position = "fill") + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "grey20", size = 11, angle = 45, hjust = 1, 
                                   vjust = 1, face = "italic")) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Restaurants Ratings per Neighborhood in Las Vegas") + 
  labs(x = "Neighborhood", y = "Proportion") 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(g1)
```

```{r include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# distribution of restaurant ratings in DTLV and the Strip

g2 <- ggplot(s_restaurants_rating) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = neighborhood, y = n, fill = star), stat = "identity", position = "fill") + 
  annotate("text", x = 'Downtown', y =  0.50, label = "Avg. Star=3.65", family="serif", fontface="italic", colour="darkred", size=4)+
  annotate("text", x = 'The Strip', y =  0.50, label = "Avg. Star=3.32", family="serif", fontface="italic", colour="darkred", size=4)+
  theme_tufte() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "grey20", size = 11, angle = 45, hjust = 1, 
                                   vjust = 1, face = "italic")) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Restaurants Ratings in DTLV & the Strip") + 
  labs(x = "Neighborhood", y = "Proportion") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(g2)

```

Restaurant rating proportion is varied by each neighborhood in Las Vegas. However, proportion of restaurant ratings in two selected neighborhoods, The Strip and Downtown are somewhat similar. Downtown has average restaurant rate of 3.65 out of 5.00; The Strip has average restaurant rate of 3.32 out of 5.00. Also, Downtown has a higher proportion for restaurants rated as star 4 or above, comparing to the Strip, which mainly comprises of star 3-rated restaurants. 

## Review Counts per Neighborhood

```{r include=FALSE,echo = FALSE}

restaurants_review_bp <- restaurants %>%
  select(neighborhood, review_count) %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>%
  filter(neighborhood %in% n1) %>% arrange(neighborhood)

s_restaurants_review_bp <- restaurants %>%
  select(neighborhood, review_count) %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>%
  filter(neighborhood %in% c('The Strip','Downtown')) %>% arrange(neighborhood)


```

```{r include=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#Review count of restaurants in each neighborhood in LV
summary_r1 <- restaurants_review_bp %>% group_by(neighborhood) %>% summarise(mean = mean(review_count), max= 
max(review_count),min=min(review_count),median = median(review_count))

r <- ggplot(restaurants_review_bp, aes(x = reorder(neighborhood, as.numeric(review_count), FUN = median), 
                                  y = as.numeric(review_count))) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0,300,20), limits = c(0,300)) +
 # ylim(0,300)+
  ggtitle("Review Count of Restaurants in each Neighborhood in LV") + 
  labs(x = "Neighborhood", y ="Review Count") + 
  theme_tufte()
```

## Attribute Analysis 

I selected alcohol selling option and ambiance as two main attributes to analyze their impacts on Restaurant Proportion/Rating in Old and New Las Vegas. 

### Impacts of Alcohol Attribute 

<img src="https://github.com/Columbia-University-QMSS/final-project-team-vegas/blob/master/plot/att_alcohol_dt.PNG?raw=true">"

<img src="https://github.com/Columbia-University-QMSS/final-project-team-vegas/blob/master/plot/att_alcohol_strp.PNG?raw=true">"

- The Strip region’s restaurants are high-rated if they sell alcohol drinks.
- Downtown restaurants slightly follow this trend, too, but boozy option is more popular in the Strip.

### Impacts of Ambiance Attribute

<img src="https://github.com/Columbia-University-QMSS/final-project-team-vegas/blob/master/plot/att_ambiance_strp.PNG?raw=true">

- Overall similar trend of ratings per ambiance, but restaurant customers in the Strip prefers “Classy” and “Upscale” restaurants a bit more.
- Also, restaurants in the Strip are categorized with more diversified ambiance attributes.
